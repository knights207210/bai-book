# Questions

## Spatial Resolution

![spatial-resolution](spatial-resolution.png)

Q. How many K-space measruments are needed to obtain a 3D image of a brain volume at a resolution of 10 by 10 by 10 voxels?

A. 1000

## Time Constraint

Q. If a K-space measurment takes 10ms and we want the TR to be 2000ms, give an example of the 3D resolution that is feasible (for example, 10 by 10 by 10 wouldn't be possible)?

A. As long as we have less than 2000/10 = 200 k-measurements. In this case, 4 by 4 by 4 would be feasible.
