Which intersections between Mind, Body, and Brain do cognitive, affective, and social neurosciences reside in?</p>
<p>A. Mind and body.</p>
<p>Q. What research problem can you think of that may reside in the intersection of all three of Mind, Body, and Brain?</p>
<p>A. Some research problems about brain-computer interaction with physical movements involved.</p>
<p>Q. Which community of experts do you identify yourself with (one or more)?</p>
<p>A. Maybe brain. But I don't consider myself as "expert".</p>
<h2 id="Modalities">Modalities<a class="anchor-link" href="#Modalities"> </a></h2><p>Q. What are the two major categories of brain imaging?</p>
<p>A. Suctural and functional.</p>
<p>Q. What type of brain imaging is more commonly used to study the effects of strokes?</p>
<p>A. Structural imaging.</p>
<p>Q. What is one major difference between MRI and fMRI in terms of data structure?</p>
<p>A. fMRI has a temporal or sequential component whereas MRI does not.</p>

<p>A. BOLD MRI and ASL fMRI.</p>
<p>Q. What are possible modalities to study a phenomenon that changes every second?</p>
<p>A. MEG and EEG.</p>
<p>Q. To study activities within a brain area about the size of a finger tip, what modalities are possible?</p>
<p>A. BOLD fMRI.</p>
<p>Q. To study activities within a brain area about the size of needle at a sample rate of 10 hertz, what modalities are possible?</p>
<p>A. I am not sure.</p>
