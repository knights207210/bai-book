<p>Q. If a tissue type is said to have a faster longitudinal relaxation time, does it imply that its T1 value is higher or lower?</p>
<p>A. Lower.</p>

<p>A. Lower.</p>

<p>Q. If a new tissue type is said to have a faster longitudinal magnetization relaxation time than that of all the three tissue types shown, where do you expect to see the line of that new tissue type lies (i.e., above or below)?</p>
<p>A. Above all other graphs.</p>
<p>Q. Suppose TR is set to 1000. Consider two brain areas A and B. A is composed of 80% white matter and 20% CSF. B is composed of 80% gray matter and 20% CSF. Which brain area may look brighter in an image that emphasizes T1 characteristics (i.e., T1 weighted image)? Why?</p>
<p>A. I think A will look brighter if the level of brightness is positively related to the measured signal. According to the formula, when it comes to T1-weighted imaging, the smaller the T1 value, the larger the measured signal is.</p>
<p>Q. Now suppose we increase TR from 1000 to 3000. Does the difference in brightness between A and B increase or decrease? Why?</p>
<p>A. I think the difference will decrease. According to the formula, I did differential on the function of difference between A and B. I found the larger TR is, the smaller difference will be. More intuitively, the larger the TR, the difference between A and B gets smaller based on the graph above.</p>
