<p>Q. Does the peak at 5 second indicate the time of the highest neural activity? If so, how? If not, why not?</p>
<p>A. I don't think so. I believe the measured signal would have some delays in time to the time when neural activity actually happens. Also, the BOLD singal cannot always reflect neural activities.</p>
<p>Q. Suppose we choose a TR of 500ms. Roughly at which frame (e.g., 5th, 10th, 15th ...etc) may we observe the peak response?</p>
<p>A. Around 10th frame.</p>

<p>This graph is used to illustrate multiple issues related to nonlinearity. See if you can identify specific patterns or features in the graph that illustrate the said issues.</p>
<p>Q. Where in the graph can we see that there is no linearity if two stimuli are closer that 5 seconds?</p>
<p>A. Every curve. For example, between curve 1 and 2. The response to 2 events are not twice as high as 1 event.</p>
<p>Q. Where in the graph can we there is non-linearity if two stimuli are more than 5 seconds apart?</p>
<p>A. Nope. No stimuli are more than 5 seconds in this graph.</p>
<p>Q. Where in the graph can we see the effect of saturation?</p>
<p>A. Every curve. None of the curve (excpet baseline curve 1) has reached the expected value.</p>
