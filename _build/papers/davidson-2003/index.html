<h2 id="Simulation">Simulation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Simulation"> </a></h2><p>Q. What is the purpose of the presimulator tunnel?</p>
<p>A. The tunnel is used to simulate the scanner environment. It can provide an early indicator of anxiety or claustrophobia that may be experienced in the actual experimental environment. It is especially valuable for children, who might easier experience some level of discomfort or anxiety in unfamiliar situations. Furthermore, it can also provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions and receive feedback about movement and inappropriate behavior while in the scanner.</p>

<h2 id="Hardware">Hardware<a class="anchor-link" href="#Hardware"> </a></h2><p>Q. What is device the child hoding in his/her hands? What is the purpose of the device?</p>
<p>A. I think the device is a button-panel. The child pushes the button on it to accomplish the cognitive/behavioral tasks to avoid unecessary movement.</p>
<h1 id="Figure-2">Figure 2<a class="anchor-link" href="#Figure-2"> </a></h1><p><img src="fig-2.png" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<h2 id="Perspective">Perspective<a class="anchor-link" href="#Perspective"> </a></h2><p>Q. From which perspective are we viewing the brain (i.e., top, bottom, left, right, front, or back)?</p>
<p>A. I think from front or back of the head.</p>
<h2 id="Spatial-Relationships">Spatial Relationships<a class="anchor-link" href="#Spatial-Relationships"> </a></h2><p>Q. There are three images of brains. How are they spatially related?</p>
<p>A. They are cross sections in different positions of brains from front or back perspective.</p>
<h2 id="Alternate-Universe">Alternate Universe<a class="anchor-link" href="#Alternate-Universe"> </a></h2><p>Q. The figure higlight the brain regions showing a robust MR signal change for <strong>the interaction of group (children, adults) by condition (incompatible, compatible)</strong>. Suppose in the alternate universe, the authors did not discover any signifiant interaction, what would the figure look like instead?</p>
<p>A. There will be no obvious color in any area of these brains.</p>
<h2 id="Variation-1">Variation 1<a class="anchor-link" href="#Variation-1"> </a></h2><p>Suppose we were to plot a figure to instead show only interaction between groups (children vs. adults). Would we see more or fewer highlighted regions? Why?</p>
<p>A. I think we might see more highlighted regions. Because I believe the highighted regions are intersections of regions for both children vs. adults and incompatible vs. compatible.</p>
<h2 id="Variation-2">Variation 2<a class="anchor-link" href="#Variation-2"> </a></h2><p>Q. Suppose we were to plot a figure to instead show interaction between groups (children vs. adults) by conditions (imcompatible, compatible) and <strong>by income level</strong>. Would we see more or fewer highlighted regions? Why?</p>
<p>A. I think we might see fewer highlighted regions. Since the highlighted regions are the intersections of multiple regions under different conditions. The more conditions are, the fewer intersections we get.</p>
<h1 id="Figure-3">Figure 3<a class="anchor-link" href="#Figure-3"> </a></h1><p><img src="fig-3.png" alt="Figure 3"></p>
<h2 id="Anatomy">Anatomy<a class="anchor-link" href="#Anatomy"> </a></h2><p>Q. In the first brain image, what is the dark circle at the center bottom?</p>
<p>A. I think it's the space (maybe nose) between brain tissues which does not show significant BOLD effect.</p>
<h2 id="Spatial-Ordering">Spatial Ordering<a class="anchor-link" href="#Spatial-Ordering"> </a></h2><p>Q. What is the spatial ordering among the four images (e.g., top-down, left-right...etc)?</p>
<p><img src="fig-3-bottom.png" alt="Figure 3-bottom"></p>
<p>A. Front to back.</p>
<h2 id="Changes">Changes<a class="anchor-link" href="#Changes"> </a></h2><p>Q. Why were MR signal changes reported as a percentage rather than an absolute term?</p>
<p>A. Because we focus more on the relative changes of MR signal comparing to control conditions, we don't care that much about absolute value. Also, it would be hard to accurately measure the absolute value.</p>
<h2 id="Baseline">Baseline<a class="anchor-link" href="#Baseline"> </a></h2><p>Q. What were the percentage changes relative to?</p>
<p>A. Control conditions, like incompatible condition to compatible condition.</p>
<h2 id="Wishful-Thinking">Wishful Thinking<a class="anchor-link" href="#Wishful-Thinking"> </a></h2><p>Q. Suppose we wish that the correlation can be even stronger for the inferior cortex. What would want the first plot to look different (i.e., the value of r, the patterns of dots)?</p>
<p>A. Both the value of r and patterns of dots.</p>
<h2 id="Flipped-Diretion">Flipped Diretion<a class="anchor-link" href="#Flipped-Diretion"> </a></h2><p>Q. The paper reports that "Similar comparisons between accuracy performance and intensity of activation revealed positive correlations in the caudate nucleus and inferior frontal cortex, <strong>with more activation</strong> in these regions for subjects making a greater number of errors. (last sentence on p. 165)" Support this finding were flipped, how would the figure look differently?</p>
<p>A. The patterns of dots would fit a line with k &lt; 0 and the r value will be negative.</p>
